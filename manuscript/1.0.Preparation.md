#### Redirection Operators

- tee – displays the standard output and saves it to a file at the same time.
- xargs – reads items from standard input as separated by blanks and executes a  command once for each argument. Commonly used with the find command.
- “ (backtick) –  Text within backticks is treated as a separate command whose results are substituted on the command line. It first executes what is inside the backtick then passes to the other command.
- $ () – Being used more often than backtick nowadays
